# IMAGE-COMPRESSION-USING-K-MEANS-CLUSTERING

You can upload your image (.png format) and compress its size according to your need. You can control how much you want your picture to be compressed by Choosing different values of  number of Centroids (denoted as 'K' in the code). Smaller the value of K more the reduction in size. In this project I have used a K value of 16.
